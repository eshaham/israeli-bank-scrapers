# Prerequisites
To use this you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) >= 10.x installed.

# Getting started
To use these scrapers you'll need to install the package from npm:
```sh
npm install israeli-bank-scrapers --save
```
Then you can simply import and use it in your node module:

```node
import { CompanyTypes, createScraper } from 'israeli-bank-scrapers';

(async function() {
  try {
    // read documentation below for available options
    const options = {
      companyId: CompanyTypes.leumi, 
      startDate: new Date('2020-05-01'),
      combineInstallments: false,
      showBrowser: true 
    };

    // read documentation below for information about credentials
    const credentials = {
      username: 'vr29485',
      password: 'sometingsomething'
    };

    const scraper = createScraper(options);
    const scrapeResult = await scraper.scrape(credentials);

    if (scrapeResult.success) {
      scrapeResult.accounts.forEach((account) => {
        console.log(`found ${account.txns.length} transactions for account number ${account.accountNumber}`);
      });
    }
    else {
      throw new Error(scrapeResult.errorType);
    }
  } catch(e) {
    console.error(`scraping failed for the following reason: ${e.message}`);
  }
})();
```

Check the options declaration [here](./src/scrapers/base-scraper.ts) for available options.

Regarding credentials, you should provide the relevant credentials for the chosen company. See [this file](./src/definitions.ts) with list of credentials per company.

The structure of the result object is as follows:

```node
{
  success: boolean,
  accounts: [{
    accountNumber: string,
    balance?: number, // Account balance. Not implemented for all accounts.
    txns: [{
      type: string, // can be either 'normal' or 'installments'
      identifier: int, // only if exists
      date: string, // ISO date string
      processedDate: string, // ISO date string
      originalAmount: double,
      originalCurrency: string,
      chargedAmount: double,
      description: string,
      memo: string, // can be null or empty
      installments: { // only if exists
        number: int, // the current installment number
        total: int, // the total number of installments
      },
      status: string //can either be 'completed' or 'pending'
    }],
  }],
  errorType: "INVALID_PASSWORD"|"CHANGE_PASSWORD"|"ACCOUNT_BLOCKED"|"UNKNOWN_ERROR"|"TIMEOUT"|"GENERIC", // only on success=false
  errorMessage: string, // only on success=false
}
```

You can also use the `SCRAPERS` list to get scraper metadata:
```node
import { SCRAPERS } from 'israeli-bank-scrapers';
```

The return value is a list of scraper metadata:
```node
{
  <companyId>: {
    name: string, // the name of the scraper
    loginFields: [ // a list of login field required by this scraper
      '<some field>' // the name of the field
    ]
  }
}
```

# Getting deployed version of latest changes in master
This library is deployed automatically to NPM with any change merged into the master branch. 

# `Israeli-bank-scrapers-core` library

> TL;DR this is the same library as the default library. The only difference is that it is using `puppeteer-core` instead of `puppeteer` which is useful if you are using frameworks like Electron to pack your application. 
>
> In most cases you will probably want to use the default library (read [Getting Started](#getting-started) section).

Israeli bank scrapers library is published  twice:
 1. [israeli-bank-scrapers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/israeli-bank-scrapers) - the default variation, great for common usage as node dependency in server application or cli.
 2. [israeli-bank-scrapers-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/israeli-bank-scrapers-core) - extremely useful for applications that bundle `node_modules` like Electron applications. 
 
 ## Differences between default and core variations
  
 The default variation [israeli-bank-scrapers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/israeli-bank-scrapers) is using [puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) which handles the installation of local chroumium on its' own. This behavior is very handy since it takes care on all the hard work figuring which chromium to download and manage the actual download process.  As a side effect it increases node_modules by several hounded megabytes. 
 
 The core variation [israeli-bank-scrapers-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/israeli-bank-scrapers-core) is using [puppeteer-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-core) which is exactly the same library as `puppeteer` except that it doesn't download chromium when installed by npm. It is up to you to make sure the specific version of chromium is installed locally and provide a path to that version. It is useful in Electron applications since it doesn't bloat the size of the application and you can provide a much friendlier experience like loading the application and download it later when needed. 
 
 To install `israeli-bank-scrapers-core`:
```sh
npm install israeli-bank-scrapers-core --save
```

## Getting chromium version used by puppeteer-core
When using the `israeli-bank-scrapers-core` it is up to you to make sure the relevant chromium version exists. You must:
1. query for the specific chromium revision required by the `puppeteer-core` library being used.
2. make sure that you have local version of that revision.
3. provide an absolute path to `israeli-bank-scrapers-core` scrapers.

Please read the following to learn more about the process: 
1. To get the required chromium revision use the following code:
```
import { getPuppeteerConfig } from 'israeli-bank-scrapers-core';

const chromiumVersion = getPuppeteerConfig().chromiumRevision;
```

2. Once you have the chromium revision, you can either download it manually or use other liraries like [download-chromium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/download-chromium) to fetch that version. The mentioned library is very handy as it caches the download and provide useful helpers like download progress information.
 
 3. provide the path to chromium to the library using the option key `executablePath`.
